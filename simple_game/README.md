Get comfortable with Pygame. Go through online tutorials and build one.

After that, discuss with your mentor and pick up a game.

Write your own code. Create your own objects, functions and constants. The goal is to try and not make it perfect.

Use the same mechanics:

    Game loop
    Calculating the coordinates of objects
    Rendering objects on screen
    Showing score
    Game end condition
