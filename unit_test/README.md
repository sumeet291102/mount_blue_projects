Get familiar with Unit Testing by watching some videos on Youtube.

Rewrite the data project. Create your own smaller dataset - like 5 matches and 15 deliveries. Manually set the result for the unit tests.

Code python functions that will transform the raw csv data into a data structure in a format suitable for plotting with matplotlib.

Only execute functions will be tested. Not the plot one.

Use unittest framework and coverage.py

Generate the following plots ...

    Plot the number of matches played per year of all the years in IPL.
    Plot a stacked bar chart of matches won of all teams over all the years of IPL.
    For the year 2016 plot the extra runs conceded per team.
    For the year 2015 plot the top economical bowlers.

Points to Consider while coding:

    mock_matches.csv
    mock_deliveries.csv
    Using unittest framework
    Using coverage for testing the coverage on execute function
