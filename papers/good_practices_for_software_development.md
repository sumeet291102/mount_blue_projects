# Good Practices for Software Development

## Gathering Requirements

- Some companies use tools like Trello, Jira for documentation. If your team doesn't use such tools, write down the requirements and share it with the team for immediate feedback and future reference.
- Despite efforts, requirements may still be vague. During the implementation phase, get frequent feedback to ensure everyone is on the same page.

## Always Over-communicate: Some Scenarios

- If requirements change and the current deadline can't be met, inform relevant team members about the new deadline.
- Implementation taking longer than usual due to some unexpected issue? Inform relevant team members.
- Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call back in 5-10 min, and call them back. This is a much better alternative than letting it go down as a missed call.

## Stuck? Ask Questions

- The way you ask a question determines whether it will be answered or not. Make it easy for the person to answer your question.
- Explain the problem clearly, mention the solutions you tried out to fix the problem.
- Use screenshots, diagrams, screencasts tools like Loom to show and explain.
- Use Github gists to share code snippets. Use sandbox environments like Codepen, Codesandbox to share the entire setup.
- Look at the way issues get reported in large open-source projects.

## Get to Know Your Teammates

- Make time for your company, the product you are working on, and your team members. This will help a lot in improving your communication with the team.
- Join the meetings 5-10 mins early to get some time with your team members.
- Try to find out relevant team member's work schedules and set up a call when they are free.

## Be Aware and Mindful of Other Team Members

- It will not always be possible for your team members to get on a call with you. Instead, you can send a Slack, WhatsApp message. But instead of bombarding them with many messages, you can write down all the questions you have and send it as a single message.
- Be available when someone replies to your message. Things move faster if it's a real-time conversation as compared to a back and forth every hour.
- Remember they have their own work to do as well. Pick and choose your communication medium depending on the situation.

## Doing Things with 100% Involvement

- Work when you work, play when you play is a good thumb rule.
- We recommend tracking your time using an app like Boosted to improve productivity.
- Make sure you manage your food situation well. Too little food or too much food leads to lower levels of concentration.
- Make sure you do some exercise to keep your energy levels high throughout the day.
